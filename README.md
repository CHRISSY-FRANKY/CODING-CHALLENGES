# CODING CHALLENGES :computer::dart:

## Brief overview :memo:

The current repository you're exploring is a collection of coding challenges and solutions that will rev up my problem-solving programming neurons to work succinctly. I'll tackle the problem in Python first, then C to gain an actual appreciation for object oriented programming languages that have fastened the pace of software development to focus on bigger challenges in the universe to make our lives easier. Even though I firmly believe that in my lifetime anyone will be able to program by simply using the English language, I'll proceed with the goal to complete this repo. If I get turned on about solving these problems I'll start an Assembly section. If I really get turned on about picking my brain I'll add a Haskell section as well.

## Context :chart_with_upwards_trend:

The college experience has fried the engine mentioned above.

## Scope :telescope:

- The challenges will range from simple to extremely difficult as I progress.
- There will be actual sketches/diagrams for those problems I am absolutely stuck on.
  - Otherwise, I was able to visualise the problem entirely in my head.  
- Eventually there will be proofs and math to determine the runtimes.

## Sources :book:

- [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/) at the moment. 
- [LintCode](https://www.lintcode.com/), afterwards.
- HackerRank, afterwards.
- CodeForces for sure eventually.

## Goal :trophy:

- Get a job to make a sufficient amount of money to make good gains trading crypto to save money to start a business that generates free cash flow to party every day.
- Not become a diversity hire.

## Challenges :mountain:
