# CODING-CHALLENGES :computer::dart:

## Brief overview :memo:

The current repository you're exploring is a collection of coding challenges and solutions that will rev up my problem-solving coding engine lodged somewhere inside my brain. I'll tackle the problem in Python first, then C to gain an appreciation for object oriented programming languages and practice implementing Data Structures from scratch.

## Context :chart_with_upwards_trend:

The college experience has fried the engine mentioned above. 

## Scope :telescope:

- The challenges will range from simple to extremely difficult as I progress.
- There will be proofs by the time I get to code forces.  

## Sources :book:

- [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/) at the moment. 
- CodeWars, for a bit. 
- HackerRank, for a bit.
- CodeForces for sure eventually. 
- Project Euler here and there. 

## Goal :trophy:

- Get a high-paying job to save money to start a business that generates free cash flow to party every day.
- Not become a diversity hire.

## Challenges :mountain:

- [NeetCode 150](https://github.com/CHRISSY-FRANKY/CODING-CHALLENGES/tree/main/neetcode150)
